# My Second Blog Post

After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

## What I've accomplished

1. **More Pages**: I added more pages to my Astro project.

2. **Component Import**: I learned how to import and use components in my Astro pages.

## What's next

I'll keep working on my Astro project, learning more features and improving my blog.
